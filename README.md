# Canvas-snake (https://gabrielgarci.github.io/canvas-snake/)

This project, a classical snake game develop from scratch and without any kind of tutorial, is a first approach to canvas tools. The application was developed in Vanilla JavaScript (plain JS) and no framework has been used. In order to reach a better UX, the UI has a slight difference depending on the kind of device which is used. Only for devices with a touch screen a control panel is displayed.

## Technologies: 

- Vanilla JS
- Canvas
- Webpack
